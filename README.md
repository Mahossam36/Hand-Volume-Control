## ✨ Features  
✔️ Hand tracking using MediaPipe  
✔️ Real-time volume adjustment with smooth transitions  
✔️ Multithreading for enhanced performance  
✔️ Customizable UI with modern colors & transparency effects  
✔️ FPS display for performance monitoring  
✔️ Dynamic volume indicator (🟢 Green = High, 🟠 Orange = Mid, 🔴 Red = Low)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **OpenCV** (Computer Vision)  
- **MediaPipe** (Hand Tracking)  
- **Pycaw** (System Volume Control)  
- **NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **Threading** (Performance Optimization)  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1️⃣ Detects your hand using MediaPipe.  
2️⃣ Tracks the distance between your thumb & index finger.  
3️⃣ Maps the distance to a volume range (-63.5 dB to 0 dB).  
4️⃣ Adjusts system volume accordingly.  
5️⃣ Displays real-time UI elements like FPS, volume bar, and progress circle.

💡 **Tip:** Try moving your fingers closer or farther apart to see smooth volume changes in action!
